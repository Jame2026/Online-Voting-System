FastAPI / Web Framework

fastapi → main framework
starlette → comes with FastAPI (for sessions, middleware)
jinja2 → templates engine
uvicorn → ASGI server (for uvicorn main:app --reload)

(or pymysql / mysqlclient if you prefer, but in your code it’s mysql.connector)

numpy → for image arrays and embeddings
deepface → for face recognition
